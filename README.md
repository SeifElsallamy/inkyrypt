# inkyrypt
Inkyrypt is an open source project to encrypt and decrypt files by xoring SHA keys generated from clients password
I made this program just for fun and it works fine with me, however I'm not responsible if your encrypted files destructed, lost, decrypted by third party or any loses caused by this program.
